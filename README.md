# Mushroom Map

This is a simple map showing some mushrooms on a map.
It's using OpenStreetMap, React v18.1, React Leaflet

## Remarks

In this project i had trouble because of my first choice (React Leaflet).\
I realized it was hard to custome events without modifying the library itself.\
So in this project you may find some unfinished works left here with the goal to show how\
it would have been done if it were easyer.\

Of course everything would have been possible with more work but\
i think it's enough to show how i work with front-end as a more back-end developper.\

Tests are fake and designed to be read only

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
