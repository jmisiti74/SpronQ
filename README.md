# Mushroom Map

This is a simple map showing some mushrooms on a map.
It's using OpenStreetMap, React v18.1, React Leaflet

## Remarks

In this project i had trouble because of my first choice (React Leaflet).\
I realized it was hard to customize events without modifying the library itself.\
So in this project you may find some unfinished works left here with the goal to show how\
it would have been done.

Of course everything would have been possible with more work but\
i think it's enough to show how i work with front-end as a more back-end developper.

If you want to see all my other projects you can watch my other [GH profile (jmisiti42)](https://github.com/jmisiti42?tab=repositories) (I lost the authenticator for it).

## How to start the project

### First step

Clone the project using git or simply download it.

### Second step

Open a terminal at the base of the project.
Install dependency using `npm i` or `npm install`.

### Third step

Run the project using `npm start` or `npm run start`.

## To-Do (What i would have done with more time)

1. Add a real server with a database and added more mushrooms over the netherlands.
2. Use GraphQL as it has a good potential with cache and this is a good point for this type of datas.
3. Add S3 server to handle images instead of having links in the code.
4. Style the map and searching tools.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Tests are fake and designed to be read only.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
